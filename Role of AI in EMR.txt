Now that we live in the age of big data, there is widespread enthusiasm for expanding the use of big data in medicine. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology that allows the use of electronic medical record (EMR) data is being used by many hospitals in an effort to improve operational and patient management efficiency.
 Various aspects of a patient's medical history are recorded in an electronic medical record (EMR), including but not limited to: diagnoses, medications, tests, allergies, immunisations, treatment plans, individualised medical care, and the enhancement of medical quality and safety. 
It is possible to employ EMR data in the creation of novel drugs using artificial intelligence.In example, it is useful to create AI that can classify the distinctive characteristics of patients in order to anticipate the emergence of specific diseases or propose individualised customised therapies. 
Standardisation and refinement of data are crucial for artificial intelligence studies employing EMR data to yield better results. It is especially crucial to safeguard patient privacy when dealing with electronic medical record data, as this data often contains very personal and sensitive information. 
Researchers in Korea are encouraged to take the initiative to make use of electronic medical record data, which is already supported in many ways by the government.
