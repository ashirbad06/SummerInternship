Prescriptions and other medical records are increasingly being kept electronically by healthcare providers, patients, and other interested parties. 
Patients' personal information is included in these reports, making them confidential. Because of the importance of data and identity security, it is necessary to save these records in a decentralised format (using IPFS and the Ethereum decentralised application). 
Many people have ongoing medical care that involves multiple doctors, multiple treatments, and multiple prescriptions and reports. It is important for medical professionals to have access to a patient's medical history in the event of an emergency. 
However, time limits prevent them from reviewing the patient's medical history and a variety of past reports and prescriptions.
In this paper, we have seen a blockchain-based framework that uses artificial intelligence to store and process medical records (including handwritten prescriptions, printed prescriptions, and printed reports) in order to generate a single patient medical history report.
The report is stored safely over a decentralised blockchain network and displays only the most important facts in a succinct style for ease of use and reading.
