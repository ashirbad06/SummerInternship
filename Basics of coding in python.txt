Python's readability and simplicity make it popular with programmers of all levels. Site design, data analysis, AI, and more use it.
Python programmes consist of statements and instructions. These steps are sequential. Variables hold data for arithmetic and string operations.
Control flow structures like if/else expressions and loops let you make decisions and perform iterative activities. Conditional statements like if, elif, and otherwise execute code depending on the situation. For and while loops let you repeat code until a condition is met or a specific number of times.
Python supports data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. These data structures organise and store many data types. Python's built-in libraries and functions cover math, file management, networking, and more.
Any text editor or IDE that exports Python bytecode can run Python code. Python runs the code line by line to produce the desired outcomes.
Python's straightforward syntax, broad library support, and friendly online community make it a good choice for beginners and experts. It's versatile and readable.
